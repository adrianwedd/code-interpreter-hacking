"""Loops is an **experimental** module for syntactic sugar for loops and control-flow.

The current implementation should convert loops correctly to JAX internal
representation, and most transformations should work (see below), but we have
not yet fine-tuned the performance of the resulting XLA compilation!

By default, loops and control-flow in JAX are executed and inlined during tracing.
For example, in the following code the `for` loop is unrolled during JAX tracing::

  arr = np.zeros(5)
  for i in range(arr.shape[0]):
    arr[i] += 2.
    if i % 2 == 0:
      arr[i] += 1.

In order to capture the structured control-flow one can use the higher-order
JAX operations, which require you to express the body of the loops and
conditionals as functions, and the array updates using a functional style that
returns an updated array, e.g.::

  arr = np.zeros(5)
  def loop_body(i, acc_arr):
    arr1 = acc_arr.at[i].set(acc_arr[i] + 2.)
    return lax.cond(i % 2 == 0,
                    arr1,
                    lambda arr1: arr1.at[i].set(arr1[i] + 1),
                    arr1,
                    lambda arr1: arr1)
  arr = lax.fori_loop(0, arr.shape[0], loop_body, arr)

This API quickly gets unreadable with deeper nested loops.
With the utilities in this module you can write loops and conditionals that
look closer to plain Python, as long as you keep the loop-carried state in a
special `loops.scope` object and use `for` loops over special
`scope.range` iterators::

  from jax.experimental import loops
  with loops.Scope() as s:
    s.arr = np.zeros(5)  # Create the mutable state of the loop as `scope` fields.
    for i in s.range(s.arr.shape[0]):
      s.arr = s.arr.at[i].set(s.arr[i] + 2.)
      for _ in s.cond_range(i % 2 == 0):  # Conditionals as loops with 0 or 1 iterations
        s.arr = s.arr.at[i].set(s.arr[i] + 1.)

Loops constructed with `range` must have literal constant bounds. If you need
loops with dynamic bounds, you can use the more general `while_range` iterator.
However, in that case the `grad` transformation is not supported::

    s.idx = start
    for _ in s.while_range(lambda: s.idx < end):
      s.idx += 1

Notes:
  * Loops and conditionals to be functionalized can appear only inside scopes
    constructed with `loops.Scope` and they must use one of the `Scope.range`
    iterators. All other loops are unrolled during tracing, as usual in JAX.
  * Only scope data (stored in fields of the scope object) is functionalized.
    All other state, e.g., in other Python variables, will not be considered as
    being part of the loop output. All references to the mutable state should be
    through the scope, e.g., `s.arr`.
  * The scope fields can be pytrees, and can themselves be mutable data structures.
  * Conceptually, this model is still "functional" in the sense that a loop over
    a `Scope.range` behaves as a function whose input and output is the scope data.
  * Scopes should be passed down to callees that need to use loop
    functionalization, or they may be nested.
  * The programming model is that the loop body over a `scope.range` is traced
    only once, using abstract shape values, similar to how JAX traces function
    bodies.

Restrictions:
  * The tracing of the loop body should not exit prematurely with `return`,
    `exception`, `break`. This would be detected and reported as errors when we
    encounter unnested scopes.
  * The loop index variable should not be used after the loop. Similarly, one
    should not use outside the loop data computed in the loop body, except data
    stored in fields of the scope object.
  * No new mutable state can be created inside a loop to be functionalized.
    All mutable state must be created outside all loops and conditionals.
  * Once the loop starts all updates to loop state must be with new values of the
    same abstract values as the values on loop start.
  * For a `while` loop, the conditional function is not allowed to modify the
    scope state. This is a checked error. Also, for `while` loops, the `grad`
    transformation does not work. An alternative that allows `grad` is a bounded
    loop (`range`).

Transformations:
  * All transformations are supported, except `grad` is not supported for
    `Scope.while_range` loops.
  * `vmap` is very useful for such loops because it pushes more work into the
    inner-loops, which should help performance for accelerators.
